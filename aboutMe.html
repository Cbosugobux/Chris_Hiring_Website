        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> My name is Chris Bushelman.  I have spent the last 20 years as a coach in competitive swimming.  I have guided hundreds of young men and women to success in the sport.  I have used a blend of art and science
            
            to accomplish this.  The art comes from relationships building, creating problem solving, and finding new and exciting ways to help athletes move forward. Even this art requires data input, analysis and output
            
            in the form of human and psychological analysis.  The science comes in the form or performance physiology.  Creating a plan for a 12 month season where there is a progression in training load, tracking of
            
            physiological adaptations and continual evaluation of things like aerobic and lactate thresholds, max VO2 capacity, and peformance related metrics (time dropped, splitting, and other things. <br>
            
            Coaching swimming has been my full time job, this includes not only the 'wet side', but the 'dry side' as well. Budget development and tracking (KPI tracking), human resource management(employee hiring, onboarding, et cetera)
             
            customer acquisition and retention, stakeholder communication, data presentation with leadership(YMCA), and other business operational functions. 
        <br>
            In April of 2025, I became a Certified Data Analyst. I am seeking an opportunity where I am able to combine my data skills and my experience to an organization where data-driven insights
            
            and decision making drive growth and strategy. After using data to drive performance planning and success, I see how important it is not only in human performance, but also in the world of 
            
            business.  In today's fast paced, technology driven environment, I hope to help company's outpace and have a competitive edge in order to thrive into the future.
